I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UFRJ, Brazil visiting CEPESP at FGV-SP. My research areas of interest are political economy, health economics, development and, more generally, applied microeconometrics. I combine data with statistical models to understand elections and their influence on the functioning of society. More recently, I have also been working with administrative databases of the Brazilian government to evaluate the interaction between public health care policies and social assistance.
