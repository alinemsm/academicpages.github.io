I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in Economics at the [Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)](http://www.ie.ufrj.br/) visiting the [Centro de Estudos de Política e Economia do Setor Público (CEPESP)](http://eaesp.fgv.br/ensinoeconhecimento/centros/cepesp) at Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) in São Paulo. My research areas of interest are political economy, health economics, development and, more generally, applied microeconometrics. 

I combine data with statistical models to understand elections and their influence on the functioning of society. More recently, I have also been working with administrative databases of the Brazilian government to evaluate the interaction between public health care policies and social assistance.
